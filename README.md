# Modern Landing Page with Animations

A responsive landing page showcasing modern web development techniques with smooth animations and interactions. Built as a portfolio piece to demonstrate proficiency with Next.js, TypeScript, and modern CSS practices.
A while ago, when only starting to work with JavaScript and React I made a mock landing page as a practice project and looking back I thought to myself "I wonder how I'd do it now with everything I learned". Here's the result!
